      <p>
      The rules of the games competed in the SamurAI Coding
      2018&ndash;19 are described here.  Note that this is a draft
      subject to change.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Game Outline</h2>
    <p>
      A <em>race</em> is a game with two players, starting from the
      specified positions, repeating acceleration or deceleration in
      each step, competing to pass the goal line faster through the
      race course with obstacles and puddles.  Actions of the
      players are decided, step by step, by AI programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      One <em>match</em> consists of two races with the same players
      with the same race course, and with start positions
      interchanged.  The winner of the match is one with smaller sum
      of <em>goal times</em> of two races.  When the sums are equal,
      the match is a draw.
    </p>

      <p style="margin: 10px">
	This course has the width of 16 and the length of 20, with two
	players positioned in the squares at (0,&nbsp;3) and
	(0,&nbsp;7).
      </p>
    </figure>

    <h2>Race Course</h2>
    <p>
      A race course consists of a number of squares arranged as a
      two-dimensional grid, some of which are obstacles or puddles.
      Race courses in different matches may have different width
      and/or length, and different numbers and positions of obstacles
      and puddles.  In what follows, <var>w</var> represents the
      width of a course and <var>l</var> represents the length of the
      course.  Each of the squares have coordinates of
      (<var>x,&nbsp;y</var>).
    </p>
    <p>
      At the start and the end of each race step, the players are on
      one of the squares.  Players can never go out of the race course
      width, i.e.,
      0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var>x</var>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<var>w</var> holds
      for the <var>x</var> coordinate of the square a player is on.
      When a player finishes when it reaches a square
      with <var>y</var>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;<var>l</var>.
      Note that players can go to squares behind the start position with
      <var>y</var>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.
    </p>
    <p>
      On start of a race, two players are on squares
      with their <var>y</var> coordinates 0 and with different
      <var>x</var> coordinates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the squares on the course are <em>obstacles</em>
      or <em>puddles</em>.  The obstacles and puddles are fixed
      and never change their positions during a race.  Their
      coordinates satisfy
      0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var>x</var>&lt;&nbsp;<var>w</var> and
      0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var>y</var>&lt;&nbsp;<var>l</var>, i.e., they
      are not located outside of the course width, not behind the
      start positions, nor beyond the goal.
      Squares not being an obstacle nor a puddle are <em>flat</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure to the right shows an example of a race course.
      Icons on squares mean the following.
      <table style="border-spacing: 20px">
	<tr>
	  <td><img src="../icons/lawn.png" width="36px"></td>
	  <td><img src="../icons/obstacle.png" width="36px"></td>
	  <td><img src="../icons/jump.png" width="36px"></td>
	  <td><img src="../icons/withPlayer0.png" width="36px"></td>
	  <td><img src="../icons/withPlayer1.png" width="36px"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>Flat</td>
	  <td>Obstacle</td>
	  <td>Puddle</td>
	  <td colspan="2">Player Positions</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	</tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>
      There are no dead ends in the course, i.e., for all of the
      squares reachable from the start positions of two players, it is
      possible to reach a square with larger <var>y</var> coordinate
      without backtracking (without going to squares with
      smaller <var>y</var> coordinate value), with velocity small
      enough.
    </p>

    <h2>Limited Vision</h2>
    <p>
      AI are informed which squares are flat, an obstacle or a puddle,
      however, the squares for which such information provided are
      those with their
      <var>y</var> coordinates smaller than the value of <em>vision
      limit</em>.  The vision limit is the maximum of the <var>y</var>
      coordinates of squares either of the players reached before the
      step plus the <em>vision distance</em> defined with the race
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the vision limit is decided on the maximum <var>y</var>
      coordinate either of the players has reached, it will increase
      when one of the player proceeds to a square with
      larger <var>y</var>.  The vision limit will <em>not</em>
      decrease even if players go back to squares with
      smaller <var>y</var>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vision limit for both of the players are the same, and thus
      two players receive the same information on the race course.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the above figure of an example race course, the squares in
      the upper half tinted white mean that they are out of the vision
      limit.  In this example, the vision distance is 10.
    </p>

    <h2>Race Process</h2>
    <p>
      At each step of a race, AIs are given information on the state
      of the race and respond with acceleration/deceleration
      instructions.  The players are accelerated or decelerated
      according to the instructions and the race state will be updated
      accordingly.  Such steps are repeated until both of the players
      finish or are disqualified.  if the race does not end, however,
      after steps are repeated beyond the step count limit defined for
      the course, the race ends immediately and unfinished players are
      disqualified.
    </p>

    <h3>Think Time</h3>
    <p>
      Certain limit is imposed on the total <em>think time</em> an AI
      can use in a single race.  The think time is the physical wall
      clock time period between when the game management system
      finished sending the race state information to the AI and when
      it finished receiving acceleration/deceleration instruction from
      the AI.  When the total think time exceeds the limit, the player
      is disqualified.
    </p>

    <h3>Player States</h3>
    <p>
      A players has its <em>position</em> and <em>velocity</em> as its
      state at the start of each step.  Positions and velocities are
      two-dimensional vectors, components of which are integral.  Let
      (<var>x,&nbsp;y</var>) be the position and
      (<var>v<sub>x</sub>,&nbsp;v<sub>y</sub></var>) be the velocity
      of a player at the start of a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state at the start of a step is the same as the state at the
      end of the step immediately before, except that, for the first
      step of a race, the position is as specified in the course and
      the velocity is (0,&nbsp;0).
    </p>

    <h3>Acceleration and Planned Position</h3>
    <p>
      At each step, AI instructs <em>acceleration</em> (or
      deceleration) to change its velocity
      (<var>a<sub>x</sub>,&nbsp;a<sub>y</sub></var>).
      Here, <var>a<sub>x</sub> and a<sub>y</sub></var> are one of
      &minus;1, 0, 1.  The square with the coordinates
      (<var>x+v<sub>x</sub>+a<sub>x</sub>,&nbsp;y+v<sub>y</sub>+a<sub>y</sub></var>)
      is called the <em>planned position</em> of the player.  Except
      for when the player is stopped by going off course or by
      collision with the other player (see below for details), the
      player will be on the planned position at the end of the step.
      When the planned position is a puddle, the velocity of the player
      at the end of the step will be (0,&nbsp;0); when not, it will be
      (<var>v<sub>x</sub>+a<sub>x</sub>,&nbsp;v<sub>y</sub>+a<sub>y</sub></var>).
    </p>

      <figcaption>Going off course</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>Move Lines and Going Off Course</h3>
    <p>
      The line segment connecting the centers of the square a player
      is positioned at the start of a step and that of the planned
      position is called the <em>move line</em> of the player at
      the step.
    </p>
    <p>
      The player is said to have <em>gone off course</em> if any of
      the following cases.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  The planned position is out of the width of the course, i.e.,
	  when the <var>x</var> coordinate of the planned position
	  does not satisfy
	  0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var>x</var>&nbsp;&lt&nbsp;<var>w</var>.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The move line crosses or touches an obstacle square.
	</li>
      </ul>
      In the figure to the right, red movements,
      a, b, c, and d go off course, while
      blue movements e and f are not.
      The movements a and b crosses an obstacle square
      and the movement c touches a corner of an obstacle square.
      The movement d goes out of the width of the course.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a player goes off course, its position at end of the step
      does not change from that at the start of the step.
      Its velocity will be (0,&nbsp;0), i.e., it will be stopped.
    </p>

    <h3>Collisions and Priority</h3>
    <p>
      When both players do not go off course and their move lines
      cross or touch each other, a <em>collision</em> is taken place.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a collision, the player with <em>priority</em> can move to its
      planned position, while the other will be stopped on its
      original position with the velocity of (0,&nbsp;0).
    </p>

    <figure style="float:right; width: 45%; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;">

      </table>
      <figcaption>Collisions and Priority</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The player with the priority is one with smaller <var>y</var>
      coordinate value at the start of the step.  When both are with
      the same <var>y</var> coordinate value, one with the
      smaller <var>x</var> coordinate value is granted the priority.
      An exception is when the move line crosses or touches the
      square in which the opponent is positioned at the start of the
      step.  In this case, the priority is granted to the opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When both of the move lines cross or touch the squares
      in which the opponents are positioned at the start of the step,
      both lose the priority; their positions at the end of the step
      will be the same as those at the start of the step, and their
      velocities will be (0,&nbsp;0).
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples depicted in the figure to the right are interpreted as
      follows.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  In Case 1, the player with the blue move line has
	  smaller <var>y</var> coordinate at the start of the step,
	  this player is granted the priority.
	</li>
	<li>
	  In Case 2, the player with the red move line crosses the
	  square of the opponent's position at the start of the step,
	  the player with the blue move line is granted the priority.
	</li>
	<li>
	  In Case 3, the move line of the player with smaller
	  <var>y</var> coordinate value goes through the square of
	  the opponent's position at the start of the step, but two
	  move lines do not cross nor touch each other, and thus
	  no collision took place.
	</li>
	<li>
	  In Case 4, a collision takes place.  Both move lines crosses
	  or touches the squares of the opponents' position at the
	  start of the step, positions of both players at the end of
	  the step are left the same as those at the start of the
	  step, and their velocities will be (0,&nbsp;0).
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Puddles</h3>
    <p>
      When a player is positioned in a puddle square at the end of the
      step, its velocity will become (0,&nbsp;0).  Thus, starting from
      a puddle with coordinates
      (<var>x</var>,&nbsp;<var>y</var>), the planned position will be
      restricted to the range
      (<var>x</var>&plusmn;1,&nbsp;<var>y</var>&plusmn;1).
    </p>

    <h3>Goal and Goal Time</h3>
    <p>
      When a player is positioned at a square with coordinates
      (<var>x</var>,&nbsp;<var>y</var>) at the start of a
      step <var>s</var>, and reached the position
      (<var>x'</var>,&nbsp;<var>y'</var>) at the end of the step where
      <var>y'</var>&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;<var>l</var>, the player is said to
      have finished.
      The <em>goal time</em> of the player is given by
      <var>s</var>&nbsp;+&nbsp;(<var>l</var>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;<var>y</var>)&nbsp;/&nbsp;(<var>y'</var>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;<var>y</var>).
    </p>
    <p>
      If the opponent player has not finished nor disqualified at this
      time, the race will be continued with the finished player
      removed from the course.
    </p>

    <h3>Disqualification</h3>
    <p>
      In any of the following cases, 
      a player is <em>disqualified</em> for the race.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> The player could not goal within the step count limit.</li>
      <li> The player's think time exceeded the limit.</li>
      <li> The player's response did not accord with the specification.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If the opponent player has not finished nor disqualified at this
      time, the race will be continued with the disqualified player
      removed from the course.  The goal time of the disqualified
      player is twice the step count limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disqualification is only for one race;
      the player can participate any following races as usual.
    </p>

    <h2>Interface with AI</h2>
    <p>
      At initiation of a race, AI reads in the information of the
      race as a whole, and, when it has completed its initiation,
      responds an acknowledgment.  At each step, AI reads in the
      information of the race state and responds to it with
      acceleration instruction.  Such exchanges are not made in steps
      after the player controlled by the AI goals or is disqualified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The input to AI are sequences of a number of decimal integers,
      separated with a blank space or a newline.  For negative numbers, a
      minus sign is put in front.  A newline is placed after the last
      integer in the input on initiation and on each of the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The response of AI is also a sequence of decimal integers
      separated with a blank space or a newline, possibly preceded by
      a minus sign to indicate negative numbers.
      <em>A newline should be output at the end of the response.</em>
    </p>

    <h3>Input at a Step</h3>
    <p>
      The input of AI at each step has the following items in this order.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Step number: The sequential number of the step as an integer.
	  Steps are numbered starting from 0.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Think time remaining: The remaining think time for this race
	  as an integer in units of milliseconds.
	</li>
	<li>
	  State of the player: The state of the player the AI controls
	  at the start of the step as four integers representing the
	  position (<var>x</var>,&nbsp;<var>y</var>) and the velocity
	  (<var>v<sub>x</sub>,&nbsp;v<sub>y</sub></var>), in this order.
	</li>
	<li>
	  State of the opponent: The state of the opponent player
	  at the start of the step as four integers representing the
	  position (<var>x</var>,&nbsp;<var>y</var>) and the velocity
	  (<var>v<sub>x</sub>,&nbsp;v<sub>y</sub></var>), in this order.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Information on squares: The kinds of squares are given by
	  <var>l</var> rows of <var>w</var> integers, in the ascending
	  order of the <var>y</var> coordinates and, for those with the
	  same <var>y</var> coordinates, in the ascending order
	  of <var>x</var> coordinates.
	  <br>
	  The integer values mean the following.

	    <li> 1: The square is an obstacle.</li>
	    <li> 2: The square is a puddle.</li>

    <h3>Output at a Step</h3>
    <p>
      The AI is to instruct the acceleration
      (<var>a<sub>x</sub>,&nbsp;a<sub>y</sub></var>) to be made at the
      step with two integers,
      <var>a<sub>x</sub></var> and <var>a<sub>y</sub></var>, separated
      by a space.  They have to be one of &minus;1, 0, or 1.
      A newline should be output after them.
    </p>

    <h3>Information Memory</h3>
    <p>
      At each step, after receiving output from AI, the game
      management system will suspends the execution of the AI
      temporarily.  The AI will be allowed to continue its execution
      after sending information on the next step.  Thus, the AI cannot
      continue its computation between two steps, but its execution
      context such as variable values are maintained within one whole
      race.
    </p>
    <p>
      AI programs are initiated within an environment where no file
      nor network accesses are allowed.  The game management system
      starts the AI from scratch for each race, and thus information
      cannot be handed over between different races.
